## Background
In recent years, finance has had an explosion in passive investing. Passive investing means that you invest in a basket of assets that’s called an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This way, you don’t spend time researching individual stocks or companies or take the risk of investing in a single stock. ETFs offer more diversification.

In this Challenge assignment, you’ll build a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voilà library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF.

## What You're Creating
For this Challenge assignment, you need to create and submit the following deliverables:

A Jupyter notebook that contains the following:

Your analysis of the ETF data that a SQL database stores

Professionally styled and formatted interactive visualizations

## Technologies
I've used Jupyter notebook to complete my code and create excellent visualizations. I used SQL to create the queries to gather my data so that I could use hvplot to plot it properly.

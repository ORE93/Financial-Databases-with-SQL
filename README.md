## Background
In recent years, finance has had an explosion in passive investing. Passive investing means that you invest in a basket of assets that’s called an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This way, you don’t spend time researching individual stocks or companies or take the risk of investing in a single stock. ETFs offer more diversification.

In this Challenge assignment, you’ll build a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voilà library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF.

## What You're Creating
For this Challenge assignment, you need to create and submit the following deliverables:

A Jupyter notebook that contains the following:

Your analysis of the ETF data that a SQL database stores

Professionally styled and formatted interactive visualizations

A screenshot or video of the web application that you created by deploying your Jupyter notebook via the Voilà library

Upload the Jupyter notebook for this assignment to your GitHub repository. Make sure to update the READ.md file to include an explanation of your project, the screenshot or video of your deployed application, and any other information that’s needed to interact with your notebook and web application.

## Web Application
First I ran "viola etf_analyzer.ipynb" on Git Bash

And it opened my notebook as a web application as you can see here

## Technologies
I've used Jupyter notebook to complete my code and create excellent visualizations. I used SQL to create the queries to gather my data so that I could use hvplot to plot it properly.
